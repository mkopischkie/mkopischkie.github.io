The human gut contains trillions of microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Traditionally, these microorganisms have negative connotations, but most are essential in immune system functions, weight maintenance, heart health, and brain functionality. The majority of the bacteria studied is found in a section of the large intestine, frequently called the gut microbiome. There are up to 1,000 species of bacteria in the gut microbiome, and while most are essential in the health and functionality of the human body, some can cause disease (Robertson, 2023). As Dr. Robertson states in a TEDx talk, gut bacteria digests food, produces vitamins and hormones, responds to medicine and infections, controls blood sugar and blood cholesterol levels, inherently functioning as a second brain.

The gut and the brain are connected by the vagus nerve, a cranial nerve that travels down through the body. Dr. Robertson describes a study that served to prove the link between gut microbiota and the brain via mice. He states that “if mice become colonized by the microbe Toxoplasma Gondii, they lose their fear of cats, and actually become attracted to them”. The presence of a single species of bacteria altered the brain chemistry of mice and changed their evolutionary instincts. Not only can the gut change the way an individual thinks, but also how they feel. The gut is home to the Enteric Nervous System (ENS), which controls digestive functions. The ENS contains over 500 million neurons, which is the second-most complex neural network (Cleveland Clinic, n.d.). The gut utilizes its neurons by producing and sending neurotransmitters, or chemical messengers. The neurotransmitter serotonin, responsible for feelings of well-being and happiness, is produced in the gut over 90% of the time. On the other side, people suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and other functional bowel problems are prone to anxiety and depression due to pain from bloating and an upset stomach (Johns Hopkins Medicine, n.d.). 

In a TEDMED talk given by Dr. Mazmanian, called Why Science Says to Listen to Your Gut, the relationship between the gut microbiome and neurological disorders is discussed. In 2016, Dr. Mazmanian conducted an experiment on mice that were engineered to have symptoms of Parkinsons. He moved the mice into a sterile environment and removed all the bacteria from their guts and found that the mice no longer demonstrated any symptoms of Parkinsons. But when he added the microbiota back into the gut, the mice began showing symptoms again. Therefore, the gut microbial molecules can start a cascading event starting in the gut, that reaches in the brain and results in the death of neurons that allows humans to move around naturally. 

This particular study that was conducted by Dr. Mazmanian indicates that the future of medicine may rely on the gut, rather than the brain. The gut can trigger an event where microbes can pass the blood-brain barrier, directly altering the neurons, whereas only a small portion of prescribed oral medicine actually reaches the brain. Only 1% of the drug Prozac, often used to treat anxiety, actually gets into the brain to boost serotonin. Dr. Manzanian claims that delivering drugs to the gut, rather than to the brain, will be more efficient as the gut already has a direct link and can cross the blood brain barrier. 



**Questions to Guide the Research:** 

1. How do factors such as Body Mass Index (BMI), sex, age, and residence affect the gut microbiome?
2. Does a particular BMI, sex, age, or residence indicate a higher susceptibility for a particular disease or condition?
3. Does the composition of the human gut microbiome correlate with neurological disorders?
4. Can we predict the onset of particular diseases or conditions by analyzing the gut microbiome?
5. Does the gut microbiome for a particular disease or condition, such as Parkinsons’, look different for men and women?
6. Are certain gut microbes more prevalent in people who share a disease or condition?
7. What food or drink is associated with the bacteria most prevalent in patients with neurological disorders?
8. What food or drink is associated with the bacteria most prevalent in the healthy control groups?
9. Does gut microbiome sampling have the potential to diagnose individuals with neurological disorders?
10. Does gut microbiome sampling have the potential to delay the onset of neurological disorders by recommending particular foods or supplements?
